# Data Linking in a Production Environment

In a production environment, the client database, call history, and statistics would be linked together using a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and a backend API. Here's a high-level overview of how this would work:

1.  **Client Database:**
    *   The client data (name, phone number, email, address) would be stored in a table in the database.
    *   Each client would have a unique identifier (e.g., `client_id`).
2.  **Call History:**
    *   The call history data (call SID, from number, to number, duration, status, etc.) would be stored in a separate table in the database.
    *   Each call record would have a foreign key referencing the `client_id` to link it to the corresponding client.
3.  **Call Statistics:**
    *   The call statistics data (cost, segments, etc.) would either be stored in the call history table or in a separate table with a foreign key referencing the `call_sid`.
4.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   The backend API would provide endpoints to:
        *   Create, read, update, and delete clients in the client database.
        *   Create, read, and update call history records in the call history table.
        *   Retrieve call statistics from the telephony provider (e.g., Twilio).
5.  **Data Relationships:**
    *   The `client_id` would be used to link client data to call history records.
    *   The `call_sid` would be used to link call history records to call statistics.

**Example Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE clients (
    client_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    address VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE call_logs (
    call_sid VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INT,
    from_number VARCHAR(20),
    to_number VARCHAR(20),
    direction VARCHAR(20),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    duration INT,
    recording_url VARCHAR(255),
    transcription TEXT,
    cost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    segments INT,
    ultravox_cost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    scheduled_meeting VARCHAR(255),
    email_sent BOOLEAN,
    email_address VARCHAR(255),
    email_text TEXT,
    email_received BOOLEAN,
    email_received_text TEXT,
    agent_hung_up BOOLEAN,
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(client_id)
);
```

**Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific requirements.**
