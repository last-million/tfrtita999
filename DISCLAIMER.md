# Disclaimer

This application has been developed and modified within the constraints of the WebContainer environment. Due to these limitations, **I cannot provide fully functional, production-ready code that relies on external dependencies or services.**

The WebContainer environment does not allow for:

*   **Database Connectivity:** Real database connections (e.g., to MySQL)
*   **External API Calls:** Actual calls to services like Ultravox, Twilio, Google APIs, etc.
*   **Dependency Installation:** Installation of required Python and JavaScript dependencies.
*   **Access to System Resources:** Access to system resources required for certain functionalities.
*   **Automatic Domain Detection:** Automatic detection of the server's domain name.

Therefore, all code provided is for demonstration purposes only and simulates the intended functionality.

**To create a production-ready application, you must deploy this code to a suitable environment (e.g., a cloud VM or a local development environment) where you can install the necessary dependencies and configure the required services.**

**Please note that the following features are simulated and will not work in the WebContainer environment:**

*   **Ultravox API Integration:** The application simulates the creation of Ultravox calls and the handling of Ultravox messages. However, it does not connect to the actual Ultravox API.
*   **Twilio Integration:** The application simulates the initiation of Twilio calls and the retrieval of call statistics. However, it does not connect to the actual Twilio API.
*   **Google Calendar and Gmail Integration:** The integration with Google Calendar and Gmail is simulated and will not connect to the actual Google APIs.
*   **SERP API and Weather API:** The integration with the SERP API and Weather API is simulated and will not retrieve real-time data from these services.
*   **Data Persistence:** All data, including client information and service credentials, is stored in local storage. This data will not persist across sessions or be reflected in the backend.
*   **Call Cost:** The "cost" field in the call history represents the cost of the call as reported by the telephony provider (e.g., Twilio). Due to the limitations of WebContainer, this value is currently simulated and not fetched from a real API.
*   **Call Segments:** The "segments" field represents the number of media segments or chunks used during the call, which can be related to the cost and complexity of the call. Due to the limitations of WebContainer, this value is currently simulated and not fetched from a real API.
*   **Client Data Updates:** The application simulates the ability to update client data. However, these changes will not be reflected in a persistent database.
*   **Automatic Domain Detection:** The application cannot automatically detect the server's domain name. You must manually configure the domain name in the `frontend/src/pages/CallManager.jsx` file.
*   **AI Accuracy:** The "AI Accuracy" metric represents a measure of how well the AI agent is performing in its tasks. Due to the limitations of WebContainer, this value is currently simulated and not based on real-time data.
