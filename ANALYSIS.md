**General Notes:**

*   **Dependency Issues:** The primary issue is the inability to install external dependencies using `pip`. This affects several backend services.
*   **Environment Variables:** Ensure all required environment variables are set correctly in a real deployment environment.

**backend/app/main.py:**

*   **CORS:** CORS is set to allow all origins (`"*"`). This is not recommended for production and should be restricted to specific domains.

**backend/app/config.py:**

*   This file correctly loads environment variables using `pydantic`. Ensure that all the variables defined here are actually present in the `.env` file or the environment.

**backend/app/prompts.py:**

*   This file is currently empty. It should contain the system prompt templates for the AI responses.

**backend/app/services/airtable_service.py:**

*   Relies on the `requests` library, which cannot be installed. The `get_records` function will not work without it.

**backend/app/services/credential_validator.py:**

*   The encryption key generation uses `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'fallback_secret').encode()`. Using a hardcoded fallback secret is a security risk. Ensure a strong, randomly generated secret key is used in production.
*   The validation methods perform basic checks but might not be sufficient for all services. More robust validation might be needed.

**backend/app/services/google_service.py:**

*   Relies on `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`, and `google-auth-oauthlib` which are not available. The Google API calls will not work.
*   The `create_message` and `send_message` functions for Gmail are missing import statements for `MIMEText` and `base64`.

**backend/app/services/supabase_service.py:**

*   Relies on the `supabase` library, which cannot be installed. The Supabase API calls will not work.

**backend/app/services/twilio_service.py:**

*   The `TwilioService` class relies on the `twilio` library, which cannot be installed. The Twilio API calls will not work.

**backend/app/services/ultravox_service.py:**

*   Relies on the `requests` and `websockets` libraries, which cannot be installed. The Ultravox API calls will not work.
*   The `handle_question_and_answer` function is simplified and provides a placeholder response.
*   The `process_media_stream` function is complex and handles audio transcoding and WebSocket communication. It will likely not work without the necessary dependencies.

**backend/app/services/vectorization_service.py:**

*   Relies on `sentence-transformers`, `python-magic`, `PyPDF2`, `docx`, and `pandas` which are not available. The vectorization functionality will not work.
*   The `extract_content` function handles multiple file types but relies on external libraries for PDF, Word, and Excel processing.

**backend/app/routes/auth.py:**

*   The `connect_service` function should implement secure storage of OAuth tokens.
*   The `list_connected_services` function should fetch connected services from a database or session.

**backend/app/routes/calls.py:**

*   The `initiate_call` and `bulk_call_campaign` functions should implement Twilio call initiation logic.
*   The `get_call_history` function should implement a database query to fetch call logs with pagination.

**backend/app/routes/knowledge_base.py:**

*   This route handles Google Drive integration, file uploads, and vectorization. Due to missing dependencies, most of the functionality will not work.

**backend/app/routes/schedule.py:**

*   The `create_meeting` and `list_upcoming_meetings` functions should implement Google Calendar API integration.

**backend/app/routes/vectorization.py:**

*   This route handles document listing, vectorization, and search. Due to missing dependencies, most of the functionality will not work.

**Recommendations:**

*   Set up a proper development environment where you can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`.
*   Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
*   Securely store and manage API keys and OAuth tokens.
*   Implement robust validation for all user inputs.
*   Restrict CORS origins in production.
