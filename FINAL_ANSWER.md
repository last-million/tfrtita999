# Are all files completed and ready for production?

**No.**

While I have provided code for all the requested features, it is essential to understand that:

1.  **The code is not fully functional in its current state.** It requires deployment to a suitable environment and configuration with external services.
2.  **The code has not been thoroughly tested.** Due to the limitations of the WebContainer environment, I cannot guarantee that the code will work perfectly without any issues.

**You will need to perform significant configuration and testing after deploying the code to your server.**
