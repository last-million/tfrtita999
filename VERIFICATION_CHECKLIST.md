# Production Verification Checklist

After deploying the application to your server and configuring the necessary services, please verify the following:

1.  **Database Connection:**
    *   Ensure that the application can connect to the MySQL database.
    *   Verify that the database schema is correctly set up and that the tables are created.
    *   Test the database queries to ensure they are working as expected.
2.  **Ultravox API Integration:**
    *   Verify that the application can successfully create Ultravox calls using the API.
    *   Ensure that the audio transcoding and WebSocket communication are working correctly.
    *   Test the tool invocation logic to ensure that the AI agent can access and use the tools.
3.  **Twilio Integration:**
    *   Verify that the application can initiate Twilio calls and receive call status updates.
    *   Ensure that the Twilio webhook is correctly configured and that the application is receiving the inbound call events.
    *   Test the retrieval of call statistics from the Twilio API.
4.  **Google Calendar and Gmail Integration:**

8.  **Security:**
    *   Ensure that all API keys and OAuth tokens are stored securely.
    *   Verify that the application is protected against common security vulnerabilities.
